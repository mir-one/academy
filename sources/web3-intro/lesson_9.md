Hi!

This lesson #9 of the Web3 tutorial.

DE-FI. Decentralized finance 

We come to one of the most interesting, hot and at the same time controversial topics in the crypt.

To understand DE-FI, let's remember what centralized finance is.

Our financial system consists of a variety of financial products, which are accessed by banks, financial and credit organizations, brokers, exchanges, insurance companies and other market participants. 

Basically, these are legal entities or individuals who are completely controlled by a certain person or group of persons, and, therefore, can perform actions in their favor. 

But one of the most significant claims from users to such a system is a huge number of intermediaries, each of whom takes a percentage for their work, as well as the complete closeness of the system, which creates conditions for manipulation by monopolists of this market.

A small example. 

A citizen of the Russian Federation wants to buy a share, let's say TESLA. In the bank's application, which he uses, he sees the "Investments" tab, buys, this share is listed in the application in his assets.

How it usually looks in reality. The bank creates an investment company, enters into an agreement with a foreign bank that has access to the purchase of these shares, and gives a guarantee that it acquires these shares for our bank. A foreign bank can itself acquire guarantees of ownership of this share through intermediaries and brokers. In fact, the action from our personal account does not belong to a citizen of the Russian Federation, and since the system is completely closed, we can only trust this entire chain of intermediaries. In case of unforeseen circumstances with at least one of the participants in this process, we risk losing our funds.

The financial system has many tools, we will take the most understandable and popular: deposits / lending. 

How it works in centralized Finance:

Citizen 1 has a capital of 10,000 rubles, comes to the bank, where he opens a deposit at 5% per annum, which means that for a year of using money, the bank will pay 5% of 10,000 to the citizen.

Citizen 2 wants to borrow 10,000, he goes to the bank, where he is offered to take 10,000 at 15% per annum, which means that for a year of using money, citizen 2 must pay 15% of the amount taken. 

In fact, the bank takes money from citizen 1, transfers it to citizen 2 and earns on the difference in interest, being an intermediary. All intrabank transactions are closed from prying eyes and not every country has a system that provides guarantees to depositors.

Decentralized finance is designed to enable users to interact directly with each other, avoiding intermediaries.

That is, citizen 1 betrays assets to citizen 2 directly, and the de-Fi Internet platform with the help of a blockchain smart contract is the guarantor and takes a small percentage for its services, the conditions for citizen 1 and citizen 2 in such a transaction are much more profitable.

The ideal world of DE-FI

And once again we plunge into the wonderful crypto world, where everything is open, users are equal and protected.

The ideal de-FI is an application deployed on a blockchain that supports smart contracts, where the creators of the project and the development team do not have access to user funds and changes in the terms of the smart contract.

Users interact with such an application directly from their wallet, each transaction and all conditions are entered into the blockchain.

Users interact directly with each other - exchange/lend/invest assets.

It sounds perfect, and of course such ideas immediately resonated with financial anarchists from all over the world, who began to create similar similar applications.

Reality 

In reality, of course, not everything is so perfect. Such smart contracts represent a variety of conditions and interactions with the world: the more complex a smart contract is, the less secure it is, and there are very few specialists capable of writing a secure smart contract. As a result, the de-Fi Internet is the most attacked in the crypto world, almost all the thefts of funds in the crypt are the result of a smart contract hacking in the De-Fi Internet sphere.

At the moment, the most reliable decentralized applications work on the Ethereum network, the leader is the Uniswap application https://uniswap.org /.

But as we know, the network commissions are quite high, and conditional 10,000 rubles does not make sense to use in this network.

Hence another problem - liquidity. Since centralized crypto exchanges themselves are market participants, they constantly monitor the availability of all assets and the most favorable price. In De-fi exchanges, prices are usually higher and the number of assets is smaller.

Another point is the provision. Since such services do not require user verification, the loan is secured, if you want to take $ 1000, you need to pledge a cryptocurrency in the amount of $ 1200, while if the cryptocurrency rate drops significantly, you will have to add more assets, otherwise the collateral will be liquidated.

Conclusion

Yes, at the moment De-fi, but also he is very young and rapidly developing, but also he is very young and rapidly developing. It's definitely worth keeping an eye on: NFT and blockchain games regularly involve new users in DE-FI products. Very soon, the new Ethereum will switch to an algorithm, which will significantly reduce the cost of transactions. Perhaps this will be another impetus for the development of De-fi.

If you have crypto assets, you can already use such applications and earn much higher income than banks offer. If you have an NFT from top collections, it can also be used as collateral - this is another round of the crypto economy.
