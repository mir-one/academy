Hello!

This lesson #12 of the Web3 tutorial.

DAO

In previous letters, we plunged into the world of games and metaverses, today we will talk about more real and mundane things that have appeared in the crypto industry.

DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization. This is a type of organization/project/community management that can be applied both in a crypto project and in any organization/community.

DAO can manage the company, attract investments, propose ideas and vote on the development of the project.

A DAO system is commonly referred to as any structure with distributed rather than hierarchical control on the terms of autonomy, independence, and anonymity.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are built using blockchain and smart contracts. They do not have a clear hierarchy, board of directors and full-time workers, they work by adhering to the algorithm that was originally written in the smart contract.

In essence, DAO is a kind of online community, club or organization, the key to getting into which is a token.

Usually it happens like this: the project raises funds and blocks them in the fund, DAO users who have project tokens can propose and vote for ideas for the development of the project. Any action and change in the organization is carried out by voting. The distribution of the budget itself takes place automatically using smart contracts without human intervention.

DAOs democratize decision making - all token holders have the right to vote. If we transfer this principle to the company, then each of its employees will have the opportunity to make a proposal that cannot be ignored.

Voting takes place with the help of tokens, which participants either receive at the time of the creation of the DAO, or buy on the market after the launch of the platform. The more tokens, the more decision-making weight, so it is very important that the initial distribution of DAO tokens is fair.

Decentralized autonomous organizations became possible thanks to the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts, the first and most famous projects are built on it, but at the moment there are many ecosystems supporting smart contracts necessary for the operation of the DAO.

Strengths of DAO:

    Openness. Since everything is connected to the blockchain, all financial reporting becomes public, participants always see how much money is on the balance sheet and where they are spent.
    Exclusion of the human factor. Since all decisions are made by voting, this excludes incompetent or inappropriate actions, spending the budget, which a person can do in his own interests.
    The impossibility of pressure and liquidation by state bodies.
    Anonymous participation is possible.

Weaknesses of DAO:

    Safety. For DAO to work correctly, complex smart contracts are required, if a mistake is made in the security of the contract, attackers will definitely take advantage of this.
    Uncertainty in regulation. Participants may be located in different jurisdictions. Different countries have different legislation, and some have not even defined the rules by which DAOs should operate.
    No secrets. Since DAO is open source, all solutions and mechanisms are open, anyone can read the smart contract and understand how everything works.

As a result, we have a very interesting tool that needs to be developed and improved, with the help of which it is possible to more effectively and honestly manage companies/communities/capital/state.
