Hello!

This lesson #8 of the Web3 tutorial.

Generative NFT collections / mint NFT

Surely many of you have heard about Crypto-Punks. This is one of the first and most successful examples of a generative collection.

Usually, to create such a collection, the artist draws a frame (image layers - background, silhouettes, individual objects), from which the computer code makes a certain number of random images.

Each image is unique and has its own characteristics (traits). For example, out of 10,000 crypto-punks, only 500 are blue, such an NFT would be considered rare and more valuable.

Such collections usually gather people in a community, and as the community grows and develops, the value of the tokens of this collection increases. And the creators of the collections constantly hold promotions and events for their collectors.

You can buy such an NFT on the marketplace, but the price will be much higher than at the beginning of the project at the NFT mint stage.

The mint of the collection goes through a smart contract, it can be public or private (for a specific list of wallets). Access to a private mint is usually obtained for being active and participating in events on the Discord server and collection twitter.

Most of the NFT and crypto community is concentrated on Twitter and Discord.

Discord is a social network that was created for gamers, it is like a forum connected to a messenger and voice rooms. The Discord server is great for hosting activities with a large number of users.

Often before the mint, the collections hold a drawing of WL (white list) and pre-sale lists, this allows you to mint NFT by paying only a commission (gas) of the network or at a price lower than the public sale.

Mint itself takes place on a separate site. Let's take a look at how this happens using the example of the Hamsa of fortune collection from Solomon.charity volunteers.

Go to the site for mint https://dapp.hamsa-nft.solomon-meta.space/

On the first line, we see the total number of NFTs (777) and when buying, your NFT number will be visible. Next, we see an address similar to the wallet address, this is the address of the smart contract, by clicking on it we get to the browser, where you can find out everything about this smart contract. All transactions and actions with a smart contract are visible in the browser, and you can also view the full code of the contract.

Next we see the connect button. We press it and connect our wallet to the site.

The collection is made on the Polygon blockchain (MATIC token), our site will offer you to connect to this network.

If the collection you need is in another blockchain network, and does not automatically add this network, then go to https://chainlist.org/ and find the desired network.

After connecting, we select how many NFTs we want to purchase. To buy 1 piece, our wallet must have 50 MATIC.

After confirming the transaction using a smart contract, our wallet creates one random NFT token out of 777 possible options, and absolutely no one can know which token will drop out to you.

Hamsa is a digital amulet that is completely saturated with good energy, the visual basis for NFT tokens was made by artists from 1518 studios, and all proceeds from sales go to the charity projects of the Solomon.charity Foundation.

After a minute, NFT tokens go to the marketplace, in this case, NFTs automatically go to Opensea and Rarible.
