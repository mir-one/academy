Hi!

This lesson #11 of the Web3 tutorial.

Game Fi / Play-to-Earn

It's no secret that the computer games industry has a huge number of users and money. People play games, buy game items, do it for fun. Many of them would dream of earning real money by playing their favorite game. And so the blockchain introduces a new concept of Play-to-Earn - Play and earn - sounds perfect, let's figure it out.

The essence of the idea boils down to the following: the user can make a profit for what develops within a certain game. This became possible due to the fact that the game concept includes the use of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies.

Similar game projects are launched in a distributed blockchain registry. This means that all the objects that players receive become their full-fledged property. 

Characters, land plots, artifacts, weapons and armor in such games are created in the form of non-interchangeable tokens (NFT). That is, they become digital assets that can be bought and sold in the game itself and beyond.

What kind of cryptocurrency will be used for calculations within the project is determined by its creators. Often a custom token is created for this purpose. Usually, you need to purchase an NFT to start the game.

Tokenized trophies, avatars and other assets can be sold for impressive amounts on the NFT market. The more popular the game, the more expensive the items in it. Thus, game resources can be exchanged for cryptocurrency, and, if necessary, into real money. 

One of the most famous projects of Axie Infinity was remembered by many for the fact that at the peak of popularity it brought income comparable to the income of a real business. 

*At the moment, the profitability of Axie is much lower.

Initially, the most popular blockchain for games was Ethereum. Later, they started moving to networks with better transaction speeds and low fees. 

Among them:

    BSC
    Flow
    Polygon
    NEAR
    Solana
    Wax and others.

NFT and games seem to be the perfect combination, but game developers are in no hurry to plunge headlong into a new world. This is understandable - the existing model of games is profitable for them, but the issue of ownership of game items and greater participation in the life of the game has long been acute among players.

The first games that were created on the blockchain are quite primitive, they were made by programmers, not professional game studios, of course it's hard for them to compete with large companies that specialize in creating games.

But the first products from enthusiasts have shown that such mechanics work. Large gaming companies have become involved in the process and can no longer deny the obvious advantages of blockchain games.

Therefore, we expect the appearance of really cool and interesting Play-to-Earn games in the next few years.
