Gas / Gas - transaction fee.

Public sale - sale for all users

VL or Whitelist - special access for users to complete certain tasks, it can be free NFT or special conditions for the purchase.

Pre-sale - a closed sale for a narrow circle of people.

Holder is the owner of the NFT.

A road map is a roadmap that describes the plans and goals of a project.

The oldest and largest player is the Opensea.io marketplace, where the bulk of trading takes place. Initially, OpenSea supported only the Ethereum blockchain, now the Polygon and Solana networks have been added to it.

All marketplaces are constantly evolving, improving security, adding new features. For example, the Ethereum marketplace https://looksrare.org charges users their tokens for activity. Binance NFT drops are sort of like an auction: you can buy NFTs at the sale price if your ticket wins the draw.

There are marketplaces that occupy their own niche, for example, https://foundation.app/ (Ethereum) is more suitable for artists and photographers, the prices for work there are usually higher, and you can become an author by receiving a special invitation from one of popular artists.

Some blockchain networks also occupy their niches in NFT, for example, Flow specializes in sports cards, and Tezos specializes in experimental art and young artists. If you are a young digital artist/collector, it's better to start with Tezos or Solana, art prices and commissions are much lower there.

An interesting fact: Hicetnunc marketplace on Tezos, which became very popular, abruptly stopped its work, the creator decided to close the project, but the community did not agree and transferred it to a new domain name, since all NFTs are on the blockchain - no one lost their tokens.

https://magiceden.io/ is the most popular Solana network marketplace.

https://paras.id/ - blockchain Near.

In Russia, the https://rarible.com/ marketplace is popular among artists and collectors. It supports the Ethereum, Tezos, Flow, and Polygon networks.

Also, among the community in Russia, many support the TON blockchain and the marketplace https://getgems.io/
