Hello!

This lesson #6 of the Web3 tutorial.

The NFT Phenomenon

In previous letters, we analyzed the fundamental and important things for understanding the philosophy of cryptocurrencies. We deliberately do not fully delve into all technical aspects, but give the most important information for understanding the basic principles. You can delve into the technical material on blockchain endlessly. It includes mathematics, computer science, programming, economics and more.

The entire blockchain industry is at an early stage of development. This can be compared to the Internet in 1991, when only webmasters with special knowledge could create websites, but now anyone can build a decent website on the constructor without any special knowledge.

According to some statistics, the development of blockchain technology is much faster than the development of the Internet then.

Yes, now it is not so convenient to use some functions and interfaces of the crypto world, but this is what cryptocurrency users are willing to sacrifice for the sake of fundamental advantages - decentralization, transparency and equality of all participants.

Today, a huge number of teams and specialists solve problems, make products, improve interfaces, take small steps towards making it comfortable for an ordinary user to use cryptocurrency. And every innovation that responds to people gives a huge breakthrough to the development of the entire industry.

One such breakthrough was the NFT. Word of the year 2021 according to the Oxford English Dictionary.

When we take the definition of NFT - a non-fungible token, a unique token, or a certificate that someone owns a certain virtual object, for many, such a definition is not fully understood.

Therefore, it is worth understanding that the most important condition is the presence of an independent network, with the ability to create smart contracts, the rules and principles of which are confirmed by the code and accepted by all network participants (such as Ethereum, for example).

It was the combination of all these points that led to the emergence of the NFT and its booming fame.

Surely you have heard more than once that NFTs are some kind of pictures on the Internet that are sold for a lot of money. But first of all, it is a technology that has many possibilities, and how to apply it depends on users.

The most important thing is that in such a network it is possible to create a token in the singular, because each NFT has its own and unique identifier.

Indeed, artists and artists were among the first to turn their attention to NFTs. After all, for many artists, especially those who work in Digital, there were practically no tools to monetize their work before NFT. And with the advent of such a generally accepted mechanism for confirming virtual property, artists around the world were able to earn money from their work, as well as unite, create joint projects and even entire virtual galleries on the blockchain.

For art lovers, everything has also become simpler: a single standard has appeared, art has become available to everyone, and the authenticity of a work in such a system cannot be questioned, since it is impossible to fake NFTs.

Art has become a big engine of progress for blockchain, and then other different use cases for the technology began to appear.

Community tokens - when owning a certain NFT gives you access to closed communities, their chats, and sometimes offline events. At the moment, there are many communities of interest, membership in which is based on the ownership of the NFT.

Game tokens are NFTs that are tied to an item in a computer game. This is also a huge breakthrough in user protection regarding common in-game items.

Now we are witnessing an increasing connection of NFT with real life. Whether it's movie or theater tickets, a doctor's appointment, a digital passport, the uses are endless. There are even real estate transactions in NFTs.

Some of these projects are sure to be successful, as they are of great benefit to humanity.

Cryptocurrency makes it possible to realize the most utopian and anarchic ideas. Fair voting, transparency of budgets, any action that requires the elimination of the human factor and the falsification of the interested party, is possible thanks to this technology.
