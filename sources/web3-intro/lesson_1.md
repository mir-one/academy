Hello!

This lesson #12 of the Web3 tutorial.

At the moment, we will discuss cryptocurrency as the loudest innovation in the financial sector in recent years.

The problem of creating virtual money has been solved since the advent of the Internet, many people, software engineers, programmers, mathematicians and enthusiasts have been solving. At the end of 2008, a mysterious person (or group of people) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published an article (White paper), which contained instructions for creating and using Bitcoin.

The concept came to life - the bitcoin network was launched on January 3, 2009. Despite a number of journalistic investigations, it is still unclear who was the creator of bitcoin. It is not only in social networks and on forums that conversations about cryptocurrencies are no longer only for social networks and for forums, but also in the largest financial institutions in the world, as well as governments of many countries.

What is Bitcoin?

First and most famous of all cryptocurrencies is this one. At the same time, another monetary unit with this name, capable of being divided into tenths or tens and so on parts: BTC. It is possible to send and receive both 1 integer and 0.1,0.001,0.0001 bitcoins.

A total of 21 million coins can be issued from Bitcoin, they are pre-programmed and have an exact schedule for their creation. The number of bitcoins is only one set to create in order to achieve this goal.

As a bonus for performing computational operations (which are the basis of the transmission of transaction) and securely encrypting information, new bitcoins enter into circulation as a gift for people who perform computational operations (which provide the protection of data).

The name of the process, which has grown into an entire industry, is mining.

The name of Bitcoin is often used to refer to as digital gold, since its reserves are small and special equipment is needed to mine it.

About every transaction in the process of processing, information about each transaction is included in the so-called "block", that was compiled by miners every 10 minutes. Every new block has data about the previous one, it is possible to store information about the previous one in millions of copies by all network participants, and this list of all blocks is simultaneously stored in millions of copies. Information about every transaction is entered into the block forever and is open to everyone.

Because of this, the network is decentralized and secure. No one can make change, cancel or replace the transaction as this would require hacking million of computers around the world at one time (which is not possible). The value of bitcoin increases with each new block, the complexity of the calculation increases and the reward decreases, due to which the value of bitcoin increases.

What we have?

An uncontrolled decentralized currency that is not control by anybody, all the algoritms of its operation are scientifically confirmed.

Transparent calculations are available to every user.

A unique financial resource, your only personal digital money that cannot be removed, frozen or changed.

A means of payment that is available to everyone, since any user can create an account with the help of your computer or smartphone, and every day the number of services in order to accept bitcoin for payment is only grown.

Well, not bad for a start.
