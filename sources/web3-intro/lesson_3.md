Hello!

This lesson #3 of the Web3 tutorial.

A lot of crypto enthusiasts are similar to space-explorers, and many times they compare them to astronauts. It was found that some are due to the high volatility of cryptocurrency rate, others were attributed by possible large-scale economic gains for humanity from blockchain technology.

We need a key. To start the journey to Web3 we need an access key.

Let's look at an example:

At the moment in order to use public services, the key is a valid document, medical services are insurance policy, on the Internet - an email. Unlike other services, there is a single account that opens the way to many services.

The key is the wallet. For cryptocurrencies and web3, the main point is for your account.

All the time you logging in to any web3 service, you connect your wallet with it. Wallets have many different models, but the main idea is that they are all one and the same.

In order to create a wallet, the user is shown his secret phrase (Seed-phrase), which can consist of 12,18 or 24 words. It should be written down, and at best not remembered by all. As you know, this words are the key to your wallet. In fact, these are only known to one user, no one ever (“support service”) has the right to ask them. Users are fullly committed to protecting his personal data and secret phrase. The user is fully responsible for the security of his wallet and secret password.

In order to guess the seed phrase, it is impossible to guess by chance, but if it has been discovered to third parties, then no one can help. In order to avoid the secret phrase on the computer, it is not recommended to store it in notes and correspondence.

When creating a wallet, personal data and other information are not used. Similar to the way you drive, you need to learn how to drive a car once in order to drive any brand of car without any problems. The internal interfaces of the Internal Interface have minor differences.

Main types of wallets

- Hardware

- Applications (mobile and PC)

- Browser extensions

A general opinion is that hardware wallets are the most reliable. As you can see, these are the physical devices that you need to purchase (required from a reliable supplier).

Ledger and Trezor manufacturers are popular ledger and trezor manufacturers. It is a device with special software, it must be connect to a computer to interact.
There are wallets that support only one blockchain network, for example, bitcoin core - bitcoin , phantom wallet - Solana blockchain, etc.

Not only that, but the most popular wallets are apps and browser extension like MetaMask or Trust. The universality of these wallets is universal and support a large number of blockchain networks.

A new wallet is planned to be made by using the most popular of TON as an example, we will create a new one

1. We go to the official website - https://ton.org/wallets

Only official resources are the main testament to using crypto! Always check, or better yet, keep a list of required links handy.

Next, install the browser extension or mobile application.

Then we are prompted to create a new wallet, if the wallet has already been created - just enter the secret phrase to enter your account.

2. Our wallet is generated!

The screen shows a secret phrase, write it down - this is the very key to your cryptocurrency. Press next and enter our words in order, confirm that the phrase is recorded.

Hooray, our wallet is created.

Before us is the public address of the wallet - 0xc9BD27039053C23F161ff4E0Ca03565b96Bd4795 (under the inscription account 1)

(This character set is an account number in the crypto world)

Wallet balance, as well as three buttons: buy (temporarily unavailable for the Russian Federation), send and exchange.

All the contents of the wallet and all transactions will be visible to everyone, for this there are special browsers in the blockchain.

If we enter this passphrase into the Trust wallet (or any other wallet), we will also get into our account.

Metamask/Trust and others are just an interface for connecting the user and the blockchain.

If you enter the passphrase from the screenshots above, you will also have access to the account we created.

3. Bottom line:

We have prepared the foundation!

And for those who plunge into the wonderful world of web3 with us, we have prepared a gift - your first digital asset.

We'll tell you how to get it in the next letters, but for now - create a wallet and keep your secret phrase tight ;)
