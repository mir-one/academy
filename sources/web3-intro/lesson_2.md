Hello!

This lesson #2 of the Web3 tutorial.

Smart contracts on Ethereum.

The success of Bitcoin inspired many people, some of them dedicated themselves to the development and maintenance of its network. Others were committed to improving it by creating new projects, others organized in groups and implement ideas.

One of these teams was assembled by a developer of Canadian-Russian origin Vitalik Buterin - the Ethereum project became an entire ecosystem and made another revolution in the crypto world.

At the moment, Ethereum has taken the best of bitcoin- blockchain and cryptography. It is notable that it has also adopted some new technology solutions. Ether is a platform for decentralization, open source code (any person can check the integrity of the network and offer their own improvements) that has been under the hood.

The Ethereum blockchain was the first to create a machine capable of making decisions based on whether certain conditions are met or not - smart contracts (Smart-contract). Moreover, thanks to this technology there are many interesting directions for the development of cryptocurrencies: NFT and DeFi (Decentralized Finance).

Ethereum is now considered to be an ideal test ground for crypto projects.

Ethereum, as in Bitcoin, has a unit -ETH, that can be sent and received. And also special tokens are made by creating smart contracts, and they have an individual unique number. A smart contract provides the opportunity for users to conduct transactions with no involvement of other people. On the basis of the contract, it is possible to include any conditions and various options for its executing.

Each transaction that is enter into the blockchain is a transaction, as well as each interaction with contracts. The user contributes to the miners for the calculations that confirm the transaction. For this, he payes a fee to the miners for the calculates they make confirming the transaction. Gas fee is called, as long as the transaction is complex and complicated in its process, the more gas will be required to process it.

When you register on any blockchain network, your account is a wallet, and your individual address identifies you to the networks. On the blockchain, contracts cannot be changed or canceled. The fact is that it is written on the blockchain.

At the moment, let's look at an example of an artist in NFT.

Ethereum network is the main network of NFT networks, and an artist wants to turn his digital art into an NFT token. He makes an investment in his art into the blockchain, and pays a commission for it. On the artist's wallet, an NFT is displayed on the artist's bank account. A corresponding record of creating the token appears in the blockchain, and also there is a record for this as well.

Artist can set conditions for the sale of his work if one of the users offers 1ETH, and then the art will be sold. At the moment of a bidding for 1ETH, the smart contract is executed and the digital asset is sent to an ownerâ€™s account in order to record the transaction on the blockchain.

NFTs can be sold or donated, each move will be permanently entered into the blockchain. As well as the wallet address of its creator, it is possible to purchase them and sell them.

Everything can be this NFT, from digital documents to pledge letters. This NFT can be any: an electronic document with the name of your trusted friend and key to gated community, an avatar or piece of land in the metaverse.

The Ethereum platform has created standards and tools for the emergence of decentralized applications and entire ecosystems and metaverses. It is notable that Ethereum has made standard and tools for the emergence of decentralized applications and whole ecosystems and metaverses.
Most of the crypto projects are made on the basis of Ethereum.
