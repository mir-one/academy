Hi!

This is the lesson #10 of the free Web3 tutorial.

Metaverse 

Metaverses are another integral part of web3. This topic is gaining popularity and has become a priority for some Internet companies. 

The term "metaverse" was coined by science fiction writer Neil Stevenson. In the cyberpunk novel "Avalanche", this was the name of a three-dimensional virtual reality that could be entered using Goggle glasses. 

According to Stevenson, the metaverse is the next stage in the development of the Internet. It combines physical, augmented and virtual reality.

The novel appeared in the 1990s, later a similar concept appeared in many works. 

Game developers also wanted to create something similar, but the first prototypes of a truly virtual world became possible thanks to the advent of decentralized blockchain networks and the NFT standard.

Venture capitalist and ideologue of the metaverse Matthew Ball in 2021 identified the main features of the metaverse:

1. Constancy. Infinite existence. It never resets, does not suspend work and does not end.

2. Synchronicity. Existence simultaneously for everyone and in real time.

3. Unlimited number of users.

4. There must be a fully functioning economy. Money can not only be spent, but also earned: open your own business, invest, sell, resell, etc.

5. Augmentation. The metaverse unites the physical and digital worlds, open and closed platforms, private and public networks. This is a "single digital whole".

6. Compatibility. Meta provides users with "unprecedented data compatibility." For example, if you buy clothes for your avatar in one metaverse, you should be able to use it in any other game or application.

7. Openness. Metaverses are available to any authors and content makers who can create their own "experiences" in them.

Some of these features are already present in some multiplayer games, but still metaverses are a completely different philosophy.

Let's sort this list by items.

1. Consistency. One of the main differences from multiplayer games is that the metaverse exists all the time, all decisions and updates are submitted to the general vote of users, creators and developers maintain operability, but they cannot make serious changes without the consent of users.

Game creators, on the contrary, are interested in the constant release of updates and new versions, all solutions in games are completely subject to developers, no one guarantees that a particular game item will be relevant in the next updates of the game.

2. Synchronicity. Such mechanics are present in several online games, but a distinctive feature of metaverse is that everything is synchronized with the blockchain, and all objects/lands are NFT tokens. This point is still worth working on, because we need a reliable, fast and cheap blockchain in order for a large number of users to be constantly in this metaverse.

3. Unlimited number of users. This point rather depends on technological progress. To be in the metaverse at the same time, a large number of users need a strong infrastructure, users at the moment also need a powerful computer, the successful development of VR glasses technologies can solve this problem.

4. This item has already been successfully implemented in existing metaverses. As in the entire WEB3.0 infrastructure, the metaverse account is your wallet, and any purchase can be made in a few clicks - this especially attracts brands in metaverse.

5. Unification of worlds. Similar activities are already underway, for example, Samsung often holds gaming promotions in the Decentraland metaverse with the opportunity to order their products in real life.

Another feature of metaverses is that all users are equal, regardless of their social class.

6. Compatibility. Work is also in full swing on this point: in the entire crypto world, the problem of network compatibility is one of the main tasks. The tools are already ready, it remains to adapt them for the convenience of users.

7. Openness. The ability to build interactive 3D objects and installations, virtual galleries and much more is one of the points that attracts brands and artists.

So, the term that came from science fiction is gradually taking on a real look. At the moment, there is no fully finished product that meets all the parameters. 

The projects closest to the goal are: The Sandbox, Decentraland, Otherside (from the creators of the NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club).

But besides them, the largest IT companies, as well as computer game studios, create their own metaverses. Of course, there will be more than just a game. It is assumed that events, concerts, exhibitions will be held in the metaverses, they will study, work, hold working meetings. There is a clear interest and belief in this industry among investors around the world.

At the moment there is no clear leader in the industry. Different metaverse are trying to create teams all over the world, and one of the promising projects - Sensorium has Russian roots.

Whoever is the first to create a project with good gameplay, economy and an indisputable mechanism of ownership will win this battle.

In the meantime, we, like the whole world, are watching the development of events.
