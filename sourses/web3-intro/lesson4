Hello!

This is the lesson #4 of the free Web3 tutorial.

Blockchain networks, stablecoins and top.

So, we already understand a little how the blockchain works and are ready to interact with it. In this letter, we will analyze a moment that often confuses beginners.

For different purposes in crypto, the same token can be used in different blockchain networks. When sending any digital token, it is important to know the wallet address and choose the right blockchain network in which we send this token.

Let's look at the USDT stablecoin as an example (this is a token from Tether, which is always = 1 $):

A stable coin is a digital asset that has a stable price and is backed by another asset.

USDT, USDC, BUSD - tokens equal to 1 US$

Tether Gold (XAUT), PAX Gold (PAXG) - a token equal to 1 ounce of gold.

Why do we need stablecoins at all?

Cryptocurrency is a tradable asset, just like gold, oil, etc.

Each crypto asset has an exchange ticket, for example, Bitcoin - BTC, Ethereum - ETH.

Trading of crypto-assets takes place on crypto-currency exchanges. For the convenience of trading, digital assets are traded against stablecoins, and not against usd or ruble (BTC/USDT, BTC/USDC).

Let's go back to the example. USDT does not have its own blockchain, this token can be issued on multiple blockchain networks. Let's say we have 100 USDT and we need to send it. If you send them over the Ethereum network, then the commission on the Ethereum network with a heavy load can be 10-20 USD (in ETH tokens), but we can send them over the polygon network (the token is MATIC), while the commission will be a few cents.

Sometimes, to participate in any crypto project, specific tokens in a specific network may be required.

At the moment, there are about 2000 coins, new, promising projects appear every day. There are much fewer working and active blockchain networks.

The crypt has its own “Hit Parade” (Top Coins), based on statistical data and updated in real time. For crypto users, these resources are the best friends:

https://coinmarketcap.com/ and https://www.coingecko.com/

Save these sites. On them you can find any coin, all documentation, supported networks, official resources for each asset. In general, these resources have everything.

For example, we go to Coinmarketcap and click on bitcoin. Before us opens a page with all the statistical data (price, total number of coins, supply, trading volumes, etc.), as well as links to the official website, browsers, forums of the official community, White pepper, open source, and a list of all verified exchanges where BTC is traded.

Of course, the lower the coin in the rating, the more profitable the investment will be if the asset grows, but there are still more risks. Therefore, it is better to study the assets that are in the top 100.

As for the NFT market, the main activity takes place on the Ethereum network, but recently new blockchains are increasingly conquering the market. A lot of good projects are already on the Solana and Polygon blockchain.

Among the promising networks for NFT are Tezos, Near, Avalanche, Flow, TON. Now all these names sound confusing, but in practice you will understand that there are not so many networks in which we perform some actions, and the principle of their work is always similar.

Study the statistics, it is very useful for a crypto addict.
