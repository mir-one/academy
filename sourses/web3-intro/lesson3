Hello!

This is the lesson #3 of the free Web3 tutorial.

So we take off!

Crypto enthusiasts often compare themselves to space explorers. Some are due to the high volatility of cryptocurrency rates, others are due to the potentially huge benefits for humanity from blockchain technology.

To start the journey to WEB3 we need a key.

Let's look at an example:

When using public services, the key is a passport, medical services - an insurance policy, on the Internet - e-mail. There is a single account that opens the way to many services.

For cryptocurrencies and web3, the key is the wallet.

Every time you log in to any web3 service, you connect your wallet to it. There are several types of wallets, but the basic principle of operation is always the same.

When creating (generating) a wallet, the user is shown his secret phrase (Seed-phrase), which can consist of 12,18 or 24 words, it should be written down, and at best, remembered. These words are the key to the wallet. They are known only to one user, no one ever (“support service”) has the right to ask them. The user is fully responsible for the safety of his wallet and secret phrase.

It is impossible to guess the seed phrase by chance, but if it becomes known to third parties, then no one can help. Therefore, it is not recommended to store the secret phrase on the computer in notes and correspondence.

Personal data and other information is not used when creating a wallet. It's like driving, you need to learn how to drive a car once in order to drive any brand of car without any problems. Internal interfaces have minor differences.

Main types of wallets

- Hardware

- Applications (mobile and PC)

- Browser extensions

It is generally accepted that hardware wallets are the most reliable. These are physical devices that you need to purchase (required from a reliable supplier).

Popular Ledger and Trezor manufacturers. This is a device with special software that needs to be connected to a computer to interact.

There are wallets that support only one blockchain network, for example, bitcoin core - bitcoin , phantom wallet - Solana blockchain, etc.

But the most popular wallets are apps and browser extensions like MetaMask and Trust. These wallets are universal and support a large number of blockchain networks.

Using the most popular of them as an example, we will create a new wallet

1. We go to the official website - metamask.io

Only official resources are the main testament to using crypto! Always check, or better yet, keep a list of required links handy.

Next, install the browser extension or mobile application.

Then we are prompted to create a new wallet, if the wallet has already been created - just enter the secret phrase to enter your account.

2. Our wallet is generated!

The screen shows a secret phrase, write it down - this is the very key to your cryptocurrency. Press next and enter our words in order, confirm that the phrase is recorded.

Hooray, our wallet is created.

Before us is the public address of the wallet - 0xc9BD27039053C23F161ff4E0Ca03565b96Bd4795 (under the inscription account 1)

(This character set is an account number in the crypto world)

Wallet balance, as well as three buttons: buy (temporarily unavailable for the Russian Federation), send and exchange.

All the contents of the wallet and all transactions will be visible to everyone, for this there are special browsers in the blockchain.

If we enter this passphrase into the Trust wallet (or any other wallet), we will also get into our account.

Metamask/Trust and others are just an interface for connecting the user and the blockchain.

If you enter the passphrase from the screenshots above, you will also have access to the account we created.

3. Bottom line:

We have prepared the foundation!

And for those who plunge into the wonderful world of web3 with us, we have prepared a gift - your first digital asset.

We'll tell you how to get it in the next letters, but for now - create a wallet and keep your secret phrase tight ;)
